This zip folder contains:

a) data.csv, mocking data with circumstances, weights and income. It is only used to set the 
example in the code. Categories have no specific meaning.

b) functions_exante.R, script with the R functions that run the algorithms, plot the tree and so on.

c) Functions_exante.pdf, includes a basic explanation of the functions, as well as a collection of the libraries 
employed

d) exante_iop.R, shows a simple implementation of functions_exante.R into data.csv. The goal is to
estimate IOp with trees and random forests. Both algorithms are tuned. A tree is also plotted.

e) Some basic references with further details about the implementation of Trees and Random Forests into IOp
